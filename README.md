# dotfiles
these are my config files for applications i use.

I am a windows user currently, and at the moment these are my config files for applications I use such as neovim and alacritty. I mainly use neovim over vscode since its less bloated and I can configure it a little easier and I use alacritty above all since its not bloated at all, and works amazing with neovim.

Neovim Issues:
Nvim-Treesitter doesn't work on my neovim, please inform if you know the fix for this issue and also, YouCompleteMe, has some server starting issues, but that could just be me. Inform if you know the fix for that as well. Other than that, the neovim works perfectly fine, and is working flawlessly.

I am currently using Alacritty, just because I thought it was the least bloated and since its gpu accelerated. It has worked amazingly, but if I can, I would like to use Hyper.js more often, just because it has a more aesthetic look. Hyper.js, however, is **VERY** buggy. If you can fix these bugs, please inform me how to.

### This is how my Neovim looks:
