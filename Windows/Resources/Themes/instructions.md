# Instructions to start using the Windows 10 OS theme

### This will change the layout of your entire operating system and it will require a restart of your pc in the process so make sure you have everything saved.

You will be changing the standard windows theme into a dark nord theme. For those of you who don't know, nord themes have a really soft and comforting color pallete which look really aesthetic like this for example: <br>

For your information, you can find [other themes](https://vsthemes.org/en/themes/windows10/) to confiugre your windows operating system, I just really like the dark nord theme.


## Steps to Change Windows OS Theme
1. Install [UltraUXThemePatcher](https://vsthemes.org/en/software/808-ultrauxthemepatcher.html)
2. Finish installation with all default configurations, and it should restart your PC for you as well, if not then do so.
3. Download the contents of the `Themes` folder and copy paste it into this directory `C:\Windows\Resources\Themes\`
4. Open `Settings` and then open `Personalization`, click on `Themes` and then choose the theme name, in this case, `Nord Dark Mode` <br>
